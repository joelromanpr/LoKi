## Including in your project
[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/io.github.joelromanpr/loki.svg?label=Maven%20Central)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.github.joelromanpr/loki)

### Gradle 
Add below codes to your **root** `build.gradle` file (not your module build.gradle file).
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```
And add a dependency code to your **module**'s `build.gradle` file.
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation "io.github.joelromanpr:loki:1.0.0"
}
```

## Usage

### LoKi
Here is a basic example of implementing a `LoKi` workflow. <br>
Any activity that you wish to protect with a passcode must inherit a ```LokiActivity```

```kotlin
class MainActivity : LokiActivity() {}
```
To prompt the user to setup their passcode for the first time call the ```launch``` function within ```PasscodeSetupActivity```  
```kotlin
PasscodeSetupActivity.launch(this@MainActivity)
```

It is common to show the "enable passcode" state with a view such as a ```Switch```  from your app Settings screen. Here is one way to approach it:
```kotlin
class MainActivity : LokiActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
		findViewById<SwitchCompat>(R.id.enable_pin).apply {
            this.isChecked = Loki.isEnabled(this@MainActivity)
            this.setOnCheckedChangeListener { _, isChecked ->
                when (isChecked) {
                    true -> PasscodeSetupActivity.launch(this@MainActivity)
                    else -> Loki.disable(this@MainActivity)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```


### Loki Customization
You can customize certain aspects of LoKi by calling ```overwriteConfig``` on the ```Loki``` singleton  object. You  want to most likely do this from your Application class since it serves as the first entrypoint to it.
```kotlin
class DemoApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        Loki.overwriteConfig(
            LokiConfig(
                appName = "LoKi Demo",
                maxAttempts = 1,
                passcodePinActiveCircleColor = android.R.color.holo_blue_dark
            )
        )
    }
}
```

## Internals
* Loki will place your app in a "disable" state if the user fails the passcode unlock workflow. Currently users must wait 1 minute before trying again
* LoKi's ```PasscodeManager``` is in charge of encoding (using a salt) the user's passcode
* Behavior might change on newer versions. Make sure to reference docs. 


## Additional ðŸŽˆ
LoKi is a fast-track way of adding a passcode lock to your applications, you can also use it in production apps, however it was designed for quick experimentation and allow teams to satisfy a passcode lock need as quick as possible. Feel free to contribute and submit ideas on how it can be improved!
